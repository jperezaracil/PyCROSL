# PyEvolAlg
Python implementation of several metaheuristics/optimization algorithms

Each algorithm is located in its package directory.

To configure the hyperparameters a dictionary will have to be given to the class of each algorithm.

## General parameters
- Stopping conditions:
    - stop_cond: stopping condition, there are various options
        - "neval": stop after a given number of evaluations of the fitness function
        - "ngen": stop after a given number of generations
        - "time": stop after a fixed amount of execution time (real time, not CPU time)
        - "fit_target": stop after reaching a desired fitness, accounting for whether we have maximization and minimization
    - Neval: number of evaluations of the fitness function
    - Ngen: number of generations
    - time_limit: execution time limit given in seconds
    - fit_target: value of the fitness function we want to reach
- Display options:
    - verbose: shows a report of the state of the algorithm periodicaly
    - v_timer: amount of time between each report
